			<h1><span>Introduction</span></h1>
			<p>
				This project provides an analysis of the American housing affordability and burden from 1995 to 2013. Three different measures of affordability are compared over this 10-year period and significant changes are observed. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The three measures of affordability include (1) the household housing cost relative to area median income (CostRelAMI), 
				(2) the household housing cost relative to the fair market rent (CostRelFMR),
				and (3) the household housing cost relative to the poverty threshold (CostRelPov). 
				Here the household housing cost is assumed to be 30% of
				the household income. The higher the ratios are, the higher the affordability measures are. For instance, if the CostRelAMI is low, then the unit if affordable. 

				Another measure is the housing cost burden. It is the ratio of monthly housing cost to the monthly household income. A large ratio indicates high burden on the household. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In this project, the datasets for each year are linked to one another for the longitudinal analysis. From this analysis, one can conclude that the affordability measures have certain trends and thus these measures can be used to predict housing cost.

			<h1><span>Dataset and Variables</span></h1>
			<p>
				The dataset is provided by the <i> US Department of Housing and Urban Development Housing Affordability Data System (HADS)</i> and can be obtained from this 
				<a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/hads/hads.html/">website</a>. In this project, the datasets for year 1995 to 2013 are used for analysis. These ten year period observations provide a consistent estimate of
				affordability of housing units and cost burden of households.

			<h1><span>Conclusions</span></h1>
			<p>
				
				   From the analysis, we can conclude that the three measures of affordability show similar trend. The average affordability increased from 1995 to 2006 and decreased afterwards. The proportions of each categories did not change significantly over the ten-year period. The relative average affordability also has similar pattern over ten years. The longitudinal analysis suggests that the affordability was increasing from 1995 to 2013 for all three measures and such changes are significant. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The measure of housing cost burden also shows certain trends. It increased from 1995 to 2005 and decreased from 2005 to 2010 and started to increase afterwards. This pattern is similar as the trends of affordability. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It is interesting to study on the following questions further:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i> What factors cause the pattern of the average affordability? What factors cause the pattern of the cost burden? What do these two measures have similar pattern? </i>
				</li>
				<li> <i>
					What is the projected affordability and burden after 2013?  </i>
				</li>
				<li> <i>
					What causes the increasing pattern of the average affordability for each category? Is there any significant differences among the patterns for each category? </i>

				</li>
			</ul>
